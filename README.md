# How to Convert Decimal to Binary
**Ashley Bigos**

The purpose of this tutorial is to educate those on how to take **decimal numbers** and covert them to a 2-base number system, known as **binary**.

This tutroial is intended to be directed towards students; however, it also applies to anyone wanting to learn how to complete this conversion. Computers use a binary number system to store and manipulate all of their data.

According to Wikihow, this is the proper comparison of a decimal and binary number is as followed:
>The decimal (base ten) numeral system has ten possible values (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8, or 9) for each place-value. In contrast, the binary (base two) numeral system has two possible values represented as 0 or 1 for each place-value. 

>Since the binary system is the internal language of electronic computers, serious computer programmers should understand how to convert from decimal to binary.

## Converting
**Step 1.** Write down the decimal number.

**Step 2.** Divide the number by 2.

**Step 3.** Write the result underneath.

**Step 4.** Write the remainder on the right hand side. This will be 0 or 1.

**Step 5.** Divide the result of the division by 2 and again write down the remainder.

**Step 6.** Continue dividing and writing down remainders until the result of the division is 0.

**Step 7.** The most significant bit (MSB) is at the bottom of the column of remainders and the least significant bit (LSB) is at the top.

**Step 8.** Read the series of 1s and 0s on the right from the bottom up. This is the binary equivalent of the decimal number.
